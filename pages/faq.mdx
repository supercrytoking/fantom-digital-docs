# FAQ

**Where is my NFT's data stored?**

Your data is stored on the InterPlanetary FileSystem — or IPFS for short. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices. IPFS is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system, meaning your data is truly decentralized. Your data is pinned to IPFS by [nft.storage](https://nft.storage).

**Will I get to keep my collectibles if fantom.digital goes offline?**

Your coins exist in the Fantom Chain — not fantom.digital. This means your coins are not tied to fantom.digital, and will exist in your wallet forever. fantom.digital simply provides a set of tools to interact with the Fantom Chain.

**I want to generate a large batch of NFT's for my series or project!**
