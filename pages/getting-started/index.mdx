# Minting

## Single Minting

Minting is easy on Fantom Digital. We think NFT's should be for everyone — not only for well-versed tech-nerds like us. NFT's are an incredible techology that should be used to document memories, share with friends, and keep with you forever.

For this reason, we spent alot of time making sure our app was easy to use.

Since Fantom Digital is built on the Fantom chain, transctions are miraculously cheap and speedy, allowing for wide-range access.

When you arrive to the web-app, you'll be presented with the option to conncet your wallet. To connect your wallet, you'll need to use a browser that supports [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download.html); a popular (and free) browser plugin that turns Chrome into a dApp browser.

Once your wallet is connected to our app, creating your own NFT is as easy an uploading an image (support for other media types coming soon!), and giving it a title, author, and description. Optionally, you can add attributes to your NFT to make it a bit more unique. Attributes allow you to give your NFT a little more unique-ness... for more information, [OpenSea has a great run-down of NFT metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards), which fantom.digital does our best to follow.

When you ready to create your NFT, two different payloads are delivered to the InterPlanetary FileSystem (IPFS): one containing your image as a buffer and one containing the NFT's metadata, as specified above, which includes a direct URI to the image delivered the first payload.

## Batch Minting

**Batch minting is unfinished, upcoming feature. These docs are unfinished.**

To ensure maximum flexibilty, batch minting requires uploading a .zip file with your assets in a specific file structure. Below are the specifications:

<br />

<Tree initialExpand>
    <Tree.Folder name="my_nft_payload.zip">
        <Tree.File name="metadata.json" />
        <Tree.File name="IMG_001.jpg" />
        <Tree.File name="IMG_002.jpg" />
        <Tree.File name="IMG_003.png" />
        <Tree.File name="crazy_cat.gif" />
    </Tree.Folder>
</Tree>

This structure allows you to upload both image assets and a `metadata.json` file, containing all the information about each NFT that will be created.

### Inside `metadata.json`

```
[
    {
        "title": "My Cool NFT"
    }
]
```
