Minting is easy as easy on Fantom Digital. We made it our goal that the abstraction of the technology would allow anyone with basic web skills to make their own NFT.

Since Fantom Digital is built on the Fantom chain, transctions are miraculously cheap and speedy, allowing for wide-range access.


When you publish your data on the Fantom Digital App, two different payloads are delivered to the InterPlanetary FileSystem (IPFS): one containing your image as a buffer and one containing the NFT's MetaData, as specified in _____, which includes a direct URI to the image delivered the first payload.

Your data is pinned to IPFS by [nft.storage](https://nft.storage).
