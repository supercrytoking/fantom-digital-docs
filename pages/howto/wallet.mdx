**NFT Wallet**

The NFT Wallet is a simple view-only tool for viewing your on-chain collectibles. fantom.digital NFT's are standardized ERC721 tokens and follow OpenSea's metadata standards — so our wallet does too. This means that the wallet enables you to view **any** NFT's you have in your wallet — wether they were made on fantom.digital or not.

Using the wallet is as easy as connecting your wallet (as explained in the previous step). Once your wallet is connected, all your NFT's become quickly viewable.
